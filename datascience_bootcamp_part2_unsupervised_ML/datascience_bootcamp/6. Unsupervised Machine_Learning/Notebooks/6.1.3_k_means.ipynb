It is one of the most popular clustering algorithms due to its simplicity and effectiveness.\n","\n","\n","![K-means](https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/machine-learning/images/k-means-clustering-algorithm-in-machine-learning.png)\n","\n","## How does k-means clustering work?\n","K-means clustering is an iterative algorithm that tries to partition a dataset into K pre-defined distinct non-overlapping subgroups (clusters) where each data point belongs to only one group. The algorithm minimises the distance between data points within a cluster and maximises the distance between data points in different clusters.\n","\n","Steps:\n","\n","1. Specify the number of clusters, K.\n","2. Select K points at random to act as the centroids of the clusters.\n","3. Assign each data point to the closest centroid.\n","4. Compute new centroids for each cluster by moving the centroid to the center of the data points assigned to that cluster.\n","5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until the centroids no longer change.\n","\n","[This website](https://www.naftaliharris.com/blog/visualizing-k-means-clustering/) is great for showing how k-means clusters and re-clusters. Please take a look and play around."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"xJrChU7o8eIU"},"source":["## 1.
