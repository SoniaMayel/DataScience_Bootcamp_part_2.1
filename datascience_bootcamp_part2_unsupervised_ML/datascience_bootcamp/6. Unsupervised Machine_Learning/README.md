## Project 6 

 ### 📊 Unsupervised Machine_Learning: 
- 🎶 *Welcome to Music!*

A project involving Unsupervised ML using Python_K-Means Clustering.
    
- 📑 **Case Study**:
    
    - 🧐  Use basic clustering algorithm such as K-Means to divide the music dataset into a few clusters and make a playlist.
    - 🛠️ add a degree of automatisation to the creation of playlists.

### Data Collection

The dataset that has been collected from the Spotify API and contains the audio features (tempo, energy, danceability…) for a few thousand songs

### Data cleaning

1. Cleaned dataset

2. Dropped unused columns

3. Removed outliers

4. Cleaned column names

### Data Scaling methods

1. MinMaxScalar 

2. StandardScalar

3. RobustScaler


### K-mean clustering

1. Applied the “Elbow Method” to determine the optimal number of clusters.

2. Utilized the Silhouette score to select the best scaler.

3. Analyzed various song features for each cluster to name playlists.

### Dimensionality Reduction
Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

## Presentation

Together with the material of my group colleagues and after rehearsal and feedback from our trainers, we condensed our findings into a five-minute presentation ([slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1vtl_E3mrlmrCyzX0OMLJIP4rVAugMiMga41rWVXppZ4/edit#slide=id.g2c63c43eeb6_2_20)).
